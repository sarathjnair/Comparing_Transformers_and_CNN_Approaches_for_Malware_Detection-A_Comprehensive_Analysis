# Comparing Transformers and CNN Approaches for Malware Detection: A Comprehensive Analysis

## Overview

Detecting malicious software, or malware is a vital aspect of cybersecurity due to the evolving threat landscape and evasion mechanisms incorporated by malware. The studies involving transformer architectures for malware detection and classification are limited. This research work explores the application of the Convolutional Vision Transformer (CvT) which integrates the strengths of both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of image recognition tasks, for malware detection followed by a comparative analysis with Vision Transformer (ViT), and EfficientNet B0, a pre-trained CNN model.

## Get Started
### Prerequisites

Installation of libraries and dependencies before execution:

```bash
pip install -q numpy scikit-learn matplotlib torch tensorflow 
pip install -q datasets accelerate==0.21.0 transformers==4.31.0 evaluate
pip install -q accelerate -U
pip install -q transformers[torch]
```
Restart the runtime session after installation of the dependencies.

NOTE: The execution environment used for this study is Google Colab, and some additional dependencies may be required for running the code in other environments like Anaconda Jupyter Notebook.

### Dataset

This research work uses [MaleVis](https://web.cs.hacettepe.edu.tr/~selman/malevis/) dataset, an open-source image dataset for vision-based malware detection applications. The Multimedia Information Lab under the Department of Computer Engineering of Hacettepe University in collaboration with Comodo Inc. came up with the dataset.  It comprises 14,226 RGB images across 26 classes, which include 1 benign and 25 malware classes. The binary data sourced from Comodo Inc. were transformed into 3-channel RGB images using the 'bin2png' tool and resized into square formats of 224x224 and 300x300 pixels. For the purposes of this study, the dataset utilized is of the 224x224 format.
